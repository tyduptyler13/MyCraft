<h1>MyCraft</h1>
<p>Welcome to the official page for MyCraft!</p>
<p>Please note that we do not currently officially support any browsers other than Chrome 47 or newer.
The features used in this game require the latest browser technology which after some testing
we have noticed that only chrome currently supports all of our needs. Other browsers will have
spotty performance and working features.<p>
<p>Click <a href="dev/">here</a> to see the latest development version as it was meant to be. Click
<a href="release/">here</a> for a "compiled" version of our code that is more compatible with other browsers.<p>
<p>As a final note, this game is still considered alpha stage and will remain that way until we feel we are
ready to release our game in a public beta for bug finding focus. Features will be held back for beta while
we try to hammer the game into a usable product. The release version will be a rolling release with story
and updates from our dev team as we produce more content. Hope you enjoy this sneak peek.</p>
